# Udacity-Bike-Sharing-Project

The Jupyter-Notebook-File [Your_first_neural_network.ipynb](Your_first_neural_network.ipynb) includes my
solution to the Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns-Project in the Deeplearning-Nanodegree. 

## General Task

The task is to use a neural network to predict the number of bike sharing users per day. 

## More precise Description of the Problem and Approach

The idea is to attack this task by training a fully connected neural network feeding it historical data
of bike-sharing user behaviour. The neural network is built by hand completely. This means that the forward- 
and back-propagation is implemented directly without the usage of any deeplearning library. 

## Architecture of the Model and Hyperparameters

The network has one fully connected hidden layer and one fully connected output layer.

* Number of hidden nodes: 20
* Number of output nodes: 1
* Learning rate: 0.6
* Number of training iterations: 4000
